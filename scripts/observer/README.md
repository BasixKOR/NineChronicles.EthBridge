# Observer

## background

Because the nine chronicles network doesn't work well, the transactions dropped often and it is hard to catch and check whether it dropped. This script does automatically.

## run

```
python3 __main__.py [SLACK_BOT_TOKEN] [CHANNEL_NAME] [-i|--interactive]
```

## lint

It uses [black] as linter.
